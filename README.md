# Short Explanation

Implementations are based on this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

Below are some of the implementations I made.

1. Load the posts from the JSON API and populate the view.
2. Each cell/row shows the title of the post without clipping ( dynamic height ).
3. Once a Post is tapped, the user is taken to a Post Details Screen.
4. The post details screen contains: the post title and description; the post author information; the list of comments.
5. I implemented a mechanism to favorite/unfavorite a post. Favorite posts should be at the top of the list. Favorite posts should have a filled star indicator.
6. I implemented offline access to posts screen.
7. I implemented offline access to post details screen.
